# Travel Journal

A simple travel journal web application built with React. Users can view travel locations with details such as images, descriptions, and links to view each location on Google Maps. This project was developed as part of the Scrimba curriculum.

## Features

- **Reusable Components**: The app includes a `Navbar` component and a `Card` component, which renders each travel location using props.

## Key Learnings

- **React App Setup**: Set up a local React app with Vite for fast development.
- **Component Structure**: Learned to organize and structure reusable components, including `Navbar` and `Card`.
- **Props**: Used props to pass data to components, specifically the `Card` component, to display travel information dynamically.
- **Array Mapping**: Used JavaScript's `map()` method to generate a list of `Card` components from the `data` array, ensuring each card is unique.
